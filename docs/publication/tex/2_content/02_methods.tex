\subsection{Tainter inspired network of a runaway society steering into deminishing marginal returns and collapse}

We considered an Erdos Renyi network with a fixed density of links ($\rho$) and stable number of $N$ nodes, representing social entities participating in a simple hierarchical society, which is made up of three classes of different ability to produce energy ($E$). Initially the network consists only of working class nodes ($W = N$), which harvest an arbitrary energy resource ($R$) to fulfill the energy requirement of the society ($\epsilon$) with an efficiency $\phi_w = 1~e~capita^{-1}$.

\begin{equation}
  E = R (W^{\phi_w} + C^{\phi_c})
\end{equation}
%epsilon = threshold
%phi = efficiency
%rho = link density
%TODO: find sybmol for muchless

At the beginning of each time step, the availability of $R$ is drawn from a beta distribution with parameters $\alpha = 15$ and $\beta = 1$, mostly resulting in $R \approxeq 1$, with a low chance of $R << 1$. When $E < \epsilon$, the network reacts by selecting the node with the highest degree and changes its class to Administrator ($A$). Nodes of class $A$ do not produce energy but instead increase the efficiency of the neighboring nodes ($C$) to $\phi_c$. In each following time step the node with the highest degree out of all $C$ is recruited whenever $E < \epsilon$.

\subsection{random class exploration as a countermeasure to collapse on a individual basis}

Additionally we implemented a random class exploration, in which a random probability ($p_e$) is assigned to all nodes. At the beginning of each time step for each node a sample ($s$) is drawn from a uniform distribution [0,1]. When $s < p_e$, the node changes its class from $W, C$ to $A$ and vice versa.
